# Feasible Solution Space Compression and Optimization for Multi-Rate Task Chain

## Paper
Updates (2025-12-06) Our paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.
Updates (2025-12-04) The code github is open access for the public.

## Method Overview
FAST is a scalable makespan optimization algorithm. It is designed for multi-rate task chain scenarios in real-time embedded system. It optimizes task and message scheduling to reduce the overall makespan for task chains.

We provide the code for our paper. The algorithm implementation code is in the main branch.

## Environment Required
It is implemented with Python 3.11.

`pip install Portion, time, xlrd, xlwt, xlutils, numpy`

## Datasets
Thanks for the open datasets mentioned in the paper, we can implement our evaluations.

For further details, please see the paper.

## Acknowledgment
